This project focuses on the design and optimization of a UHF RFID tag chip antenna, developed using CST Studio Suite 2018. RFID technology enables automatic identification through radio-frequency communication, and UHF systems offer the advantages of long-range reading and large information storage capacity. Our tag antenna operates within the European UHF frequency range of 865-868 MHz, with a primary focus on achieving impedance matching for efficient power transfer between the chip and the antenna. The CST simulator facilitated the design process by enabling 3D modeling, electromagnetic field analysis, and optimization, ensuring the antenna's performance aligns with desired specifications.

Key aspects of the project include the iterative modification of antenna dimensions, fabrication using copper sheets, and testing to evaluate the maximum read distance. By simulating the impedance, optimizing dimensions, and conducting experimental validations, the final design demonstrated a read range improvement from 31 cm to 150 cm. The outcome underscores the effectiveness of CST in designing low-cost, compact RFID antennas for practical applications. This report highlights the integration of theoretical knowledge and simulation tools to achieve functional, cost-efficient antenna designs.
